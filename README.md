## TODO

  - Scanner: scanner can be used for adding product details so that we get details
  - Expired: List of expire product which can be used for replacement or discarding

## HOME

- Home Page will have a list of data which will expire with colors,based on days
- Home Page will have a indicator to show how much products are expired, good,bad and worse rating indicator.
- Also customer satisfactory rating system on home page.

## Scanner
- Scanner will be used for scanner the barcode of the product which will give barcode number,
- On detecting barcode number, we will redirect to form page and we will autofill the bar code and there will be other fields where we can add expiry date from calender.

## Expired
